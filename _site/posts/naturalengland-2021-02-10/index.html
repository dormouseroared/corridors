        <h2>Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund</h2>

<ul><li><em>Looking for information about what type of seeds to use for a species rich hay meadow in a now archived Natural England Technical Information Note, and found this looking whilst for the current version. It turns out that TIN038 has been archived without replacement or explanation.</em></li></ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-10-million-fund-to-drive-private-sector-investment-in-nature--2">New £10 million fund to drive private sector investment in nature </a></p>
<p>This announcement was published on 10 February 2021.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at what it says, and what it means.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/114131/s300_Rural_pond_in_England_GettyImages-1167774722_1_960x640.jpg" alt="Rural pond in England"></p>
<p>From the website, and with a bit of extra layout and pruning...</p>
<h2>First extract from the announcement</h2>
<p>&quot;Nature projects which tackle:</p>
<ul>
<li>climate change,</li>
<li>create and restore habitats, or</li>
<li>improve water quality</li>
</ul>
<p>could soon benefit from a <strong>new £10 million fund</strong> to help them both benefit the environment and attract private sector investment...</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-grant-from-the-natural-environment-investment-readiness-fund">Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund</a> will provide grants of up to £100,000 to environmental groups, local authorities, businesses and other organisations to help them develop nature projects in England to a point where they can attract private investment.</p>
<p>This will create a pipeline of projects for the private sector to invest in, and develop new funding models that can be replicated elsewhere, demonstrating the UK’s leadership in nature finance in the run-up to <span class="badge success">COP26</span> in November, 2021.&quot;</p>
<h2>Questions so far</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the objective to get a set of &quot;spade ready&quot; projects ready with clear objectives, feasibility completed, costs and resources clearly laid out?</li>
<li>£10 million doesn't sound a lot but it could go a lot further if it is just to develop &quot;spade ready&quot; projects</li>
<li>Why would the private sector invest in these projects? How will they get a financial return? Or will other &quot;public goods&quot; returns be valued?</li>
<li>Is there any evidence to support the assertion that the UK has demonstrated any leadership in nature finance thus far?</li>
<li>Many uses of terms like <strong>net zero</strong> and <strong>offset emissions</strong> are a cause for concern. More emphasis on cutting carbon use down towards zero would be a better demonstration of UK leadership and reduce the suspicion of greenwashing and double counting (or over estimation) of carbon storage.</li>
<li>Is this all looking a bit like last minute window dressing for <span class="badge success">COP26</span>?</li>
<li>This scheme indicates England only, so what about elsewhere in the UK?</li>
<li>Have other schemes like this been carried out anywhere in the UK? What happened to them? Can anything be learned from schemes like this in other countries?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Second extract from the announcement</h2>
<p>Examples of projects that could be eligible for the fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>the creation of <strong>new woodlands</strong> and the <strong>restoration of peatlands</strong>, providing habitats for wildlife, green spaces for the public and carbon sequestration to help the government achieve its net zero target. This will generate <em>carbon units which can be sold to businesses that want to offset emissions</em>.</li>
<li>the creation of <strong>new coastal wetlands</strong>, which benefit wildlife and reduce tidal flooding, while also attracting investment from developers needing to deliver biodiversity net gain and even delivering revenue through eco-tourism.</li>
<li>the <strong>restoration of river catchments</strong>, helping to both improve water quality and reduce flood risk. As well as benefitting nature and people, these environmental benefits will deliver financial incentives to water companies (with reduced costs for water treatment) and encouraging them to invest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Third extract (the sound bites)</h2>
<p>Environment Minister <button>Rebecca Pow</Button> said:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Our 25 Year Environment Plan made clear that while the public sector 
will continue to be a central source of funding, it is critical that 
this is alongside more private sector investment to protect and enhance 
our natural environment.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Environment Minister <button>Rebecca Pow</button> said:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Investors are rightly recognising environmental factors as key drivers 
of value. As we look to build back greener from the pandemic, I would 
encourage any interested businesses, local authorities, eNGOs or other 
organisations to bid for a portion of this fund.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><button>Emma Howard Boyd</button>, Chair of the Environment Agency, said:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;The Government are calling for a green industrial revolution at the 
same time that investors, including people saving for their pensions, 
are looking for economic returns that reverse natural decline and 
manage climate shocks.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><button>Emma Howard Boyd</button>, Chair of the Environment Agency, said:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;There are already examples of this happening, but the global economy 
needs more evidence if it is going to reach a tipping point that 
mobilises trillions of dollars towards nature. This fund will help, 
demonstrating funding models that can be replicated, providing 
long-term benefits for the economy and the environment, and showing 
UK leadership ahead of COP26.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Next extract</h2>
<p>The pioneering fund, which is being delivered by the Environment Agency on behalf of Defra, will help organisations get specialist advice, engage investors and build capacity to develop their project to the stage when it is ready to receive and repay investment.</p>
<p>Projects need to be replicable and scalable, with key learnings made public to encourage similar approaches to access private sector finance for nature projects in future.</p>
<p>Chief Executive, Green Finance Institute, said:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;There are many important nature-based projects that, with 
technical assistance and catalytic funding, could meet 
investor requirements and demand, and secure the private 
capital to help them achieve their missions. The NEIRF 
will serve as an essential bridge, as well as providing an 
example of how to build an investment pipeline for nature.

We are delighted to have been able to support the 
Environment Agency and Defra in the Fund’s development 
and to continue our involvement in ensuring its success.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Last extract</h2>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nature-is-a-blind-spot-in-economics-that-we-ignore-at-our-peril-says-dasgupta-review">Dasgupta Review</a> having recently made clear the value of nature to our economy and society, green finance will be essential to addressing the defining environmental challenges of our time, including climate change, moving to net zero, protecting biodiversity and improving the water environment.</p>
