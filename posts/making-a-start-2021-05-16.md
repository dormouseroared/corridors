* Understand your own resources, experience. Can you learn from similar approaches?
* Find out who owns or manages the verges, hedgerows, meadows or woodland in your area.
* Find out what their plans or working practices are for diversity, wildlife, soil health, water retention, access, growth, cutting back, etc.
* Compare and contrast to best practice in the 21st century with regard to wildlife, carbon capture, assessment of now versus future, etc.
* Next steps are entirely situational, ranging from holding to account, to planting and maintaining a hedgerow to encourage biodiversity, to a landscape scale project involving many parties.
