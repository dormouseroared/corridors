Verges. Are. Important.

Let's nurture our verges. They can be useful in so many ways if we do the right things. Of course, starting research into verges can lead to other topics such as community orchards, hedgerows, gardens, meadows and other ways to encourage the right things to happen in the right places.

In no particular order, let's start with the [Plantlife Road Verge Campaign](https://plantlife.love-wildflowers.org.uk/roadvergecampaign), to find out more, including the 24 page pdf [Good Verge Guide: your go-to guide for transforming local verges into wildlife havens](https://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/our-work/publications/good-verge-guide-different-approach-managing-our-waysides-and-verges) and the [Plantlife managing grassland road verges best practice guide](https://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/about-us/news/road-verge-management-guide).
