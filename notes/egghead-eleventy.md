[very useful egghead course with many tips](https://egghead.io/lessons/11ty-create-an-eleventy-11ty-site-from-scratch)

* eleventy is a `scoped package` hence `npm install @11ty/eleventy`
* added start and build to package.json scripts section so that `npm run start` and `npm run build` both work
* watch out for yaml errors which do not make it clear which file is in error. Proobably the last one updated, and it will have a quotation mark or similar missing.
* see also **random post** instructions 
* see also creating a collection from a remote cms
