Have carried out an initial go at using tags using this [eleventy doc page](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/tag-pages/)

New tags have been added to the corridors posts.

<kbd>tags.njk</kbd> has been created, copied from the article above, and this generates the <kbd>tags/"tag"</kbd> pages, but spaces are not replace by dashes.

Still have to work out how to dispay the tags on the post page or the index page.

Still have to work out how to display a summary of tags.
